Repoman
=======

Repoman (Repository Manager) is a package for MODX Revolution (http://modx.com/) that makes it 
easier for developers to develop MODX packages or contribute to existing MODX projects.  
It is coming to take the complexity away!

Repoman introduces a simplified approach to developing packages for MODX Revolution so developers can 
easily contribute to code without painful installations in each environment. 

The two main features of Repoman are:

1. Any MODX package or AddOn that follows Repoman's conventions does not need a \_build directory or a build.transport.php file: 
Repoman can crawl the directory structure and create the package without any extra work by the developer.

2. Any public MODX project (e.g. those hosted by Github) can be cloned to a local dev environment and Repoman can pull them 
into the local MODX installation by creating any Snippets, Chunks, Templates, System Settings, Custom Manager Pages, or 
custom database tables, *all without installing a MODX transport package*.
