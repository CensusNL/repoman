A lot o' people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch o' unconnected incidents 'n things. 
They don't realize that there's this, like, lattice o' coincidence that lays on top o' everything. Give you an 
example; show you what I mean: suppose you're thinkin' about a plate o' shrimp. Suddenly someone'll say, like, 
plate, or shrimp, or plate o' shrimp out of the blue, no explanation. No point in lookin' for one, either. It's 
all part of a cosmic unconciousness.
