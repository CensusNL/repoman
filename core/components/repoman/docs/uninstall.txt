Uninstall

This attempts to clean out your MODX installation from any elements or database migrations.
This is not guaranteed to remove everything that Repoman created -- the papertrail might 
get lost, especially if you have changed the names of your elements.

    php repoman.php uninstall <path_to_repo>
    
This will execute the migrations/uninstall.php (if present).
