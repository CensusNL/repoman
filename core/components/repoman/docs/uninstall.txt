Uninstall

This attempts to clean out your MODX installation from any elements or database migrations.
This is not guaranteed to remove everything that Repoman created -- the paper trail might 
get lost, especially if you have manually cleared out your cache directory or have changed 
names of your elements.

    php repoman.php uninstall <pkg_root_dir>
    
This will execute the migrations/uninstall.php (if present).
