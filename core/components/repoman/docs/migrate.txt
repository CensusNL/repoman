Migrate

Run any database migrations defined in the project's database/migrations/ folder.

Usage:

    php repoman.php migrate <path_to_repo>

This function will first execute the "uninstall.php" script to clean out the database,
then it will run the "install.php" script to create custom tables.

If you need to populate your database tables with some custom data, use the --seeds parameter.
