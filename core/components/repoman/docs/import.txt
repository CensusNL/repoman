Import

Import elements from the filesystem into MODX, including templates, chunks, 
and snippets.  You may use the import function periodically as you add files 
to your project's repository.

Usage:

    php repoman.php import <pkg_root_dir>
    
Parameters:

    --dry_run : set this to see what elements would be imported. Default: false
    
    --require_docblocks : set to true if you want to skip any elements that 
        don't have a DocBlock defined. You may also set the "@no_import" 
        attribute in the DocBlock of any element that you do not wish to import.
        Default: false.
        
    --force_static : Normally during development you want to store your elements 
        as static elements that live on the filesystem, but you may override this
        behavior if you wish by setting this to false.  Default: true.
