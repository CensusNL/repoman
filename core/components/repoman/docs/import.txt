Import

Import elements and objects from the filesystem into MODX, including templates, chunks, 
and snippets, but also any objects defined by the package.  You may use the import 
function periodically as you add files to your project.

Usage:

    php repoman.php import <path_to_repo>
    
This respects the xPDOTransport::UPDATE_OBJECT settings for the objects involved so that 
some records will not be overwritten (i.e. updated) after they are first installed.  
This behavior is usually desired primarily for settings: the package defines the setting's 
name and description, but the user supplies the value.
