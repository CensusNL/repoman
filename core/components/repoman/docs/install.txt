Install

Install into MODX all the AddOn's elements and run all package migrations. The end result
should appear the same as if you had installed the AddOn via a MODX package.

Usage:

    php repoman install <pkg_root_dir>
    

Running "install" is equivalent to running "import", "migrate", and "seed" commands.
