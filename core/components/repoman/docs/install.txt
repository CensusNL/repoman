Install

Install into MODX all the AddOn's elements and run all package migrations. The end result
should appear the same as if you had installed the AddOn via a MODX package.

Usage:

    php repoman.php install <path_to_repo>
    

Running "install" is equivalent to running both "import" then "migrate"
