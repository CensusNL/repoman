Build

Build a MODX transport package from the files in the specified repository directory.  You can then
submit this transport package to the official directory of MODX Extras (http://modx.com/extras/)
or you can copy the package to other MODX sites and install it there.

Usage:

    php repoman.php build <path_to_repo>

Make sure you have updated your package's config.php with the latest information.  The following
configuration details are required for a successful build:

* package_name
* namespace
* version
* release

These attributes should be set in your project's config.php file, however if you are feeling lazy
you can set the options at run-time using command-line options:

    php repoman.php build <path_to_repo> --version=1.0.0 --log_level=4
    
If you need to quote values, you should quote the key and the value, e.g.

    php repoman.php build <path_to_repo> '--package_name=My Package'
