Graph

The graph command prints all of an object's attributes and it includes meta data for each defined 
relation.  This is useful for creating seed data or for using the getObjectGraph() and 
getCollectionGraph methods(). 

Usage:

    php repoman graph [<classname>] [options]
    
If <classname> is omitted, all available MODX classes will be shown.
<classname> must be a recognized MODX object type classname.  By default both
aggregate and composite relations are shown.

Available options are:

    --aggregates (optional) if set, the output will show only aggregate objects.
    --composites (optional) if set, the output will show only composite objects
    --pkg (optional) use this to load additional packages via addPackage.
        Format is '<package>:<model_path>:<table_prefix>'
    
Examples:

    php repoman graph MyObject '--pkg=mypkg:/full/path/to/core/components/mypkg/model/:xyz_'
