Graph

This function helps you examine objects and their relations so you can structure your seed data correctly.
It prints all of an object's attributes and meta data is shown for each related object.  This is useful
for creating seed data or for using the getObjectGraph() and getCollectionGraph methods(). 

Usage:

    php repoman.php map [<classname>] [options]
    
If <classname> is omitted, all available MODX classes will be shown.
<classname> must be a recognized MODX object type classname. 

Available options are:

    --aggregates (optional) if set, the output will show only aggregate objects.
    --composites (optional) if set, the output will show only composite objects
    --pkg (optional) use this to load additional packages via addPackage.
        Format is '<package>:<model_path>:<table_prefix>'
    
Examples:

    php repoman.php map MyObject '--pkg=mypkg:/full/path/to/core/components/mypkg/model/:xyz_'
