Look

This function helps you examine objects and their relations so you can structure your object 
and seed data correctly.

Usage:

    php repoman.php look [<classname>] [options]
    
<classname> must be a recognized MODX object type classname.  If omitted, a list of all available
classnames is shown.

The output is an array structure for an object instance of the selected classname.

Available options are:

    --relations (optional) if set, the output will include both aggregates and composites of the class.
    --aggregates (optional) if set, the output will show aggregate objects.
    --composites (optional) if set, the output will show composite objects
    --classmap (option) add this to one of the above and the aliases will show class definitions of the related classes.
