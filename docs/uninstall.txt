Uninstall

This attempts to clean out your MODX installation from any elements or database migrations
that were made under the namespace of the referenced package. This may not remove everything,
especially if you have manually cleared out your cache directory or have changed 
names of your elements.

    php repoman uninstall <pkg_root_dir>
    
This will also execute the migrations/uninstall.php (if present).
