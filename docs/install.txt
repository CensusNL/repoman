Install

Install into MODX all the package elements and run all migrations. The end result
should appear the same as if you had built the package and installed it via the MODX package manager.

Usage:

    php repoman install <pkg_root_dir>
    

Running "install" is equivalent to running "import", "migrate", and "seed" commands.

Warning, this can overwrite custom data structures or other objects associated with the package.
