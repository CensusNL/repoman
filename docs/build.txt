Make sure you have updated your package's composer.json with the latest information.  The following
configuration "extra" attributes are required for a successful build:

* package_name
* namespace
* version
* release

Once built, you can submit the zip package to the official directory of MODX Extras (http://modx.com/extras/)
or you can copy the package to other MODX sites and install it there.
