Schema:parse

This function parses an existing XML schema file and creates the corresponding ORM PHP classes.
Use this function when you have changed your database schema (e.g. added tables or columns).
This corresponds to the parseSchema() method of the xPDO generator class.

Usage:

    php repoman schema:parse <pkg_root_dir> --model=<model-name> [options]



Options

--model : (string, defaults to namespace) 
    Specifies 1) which XML schema file is to be parsed by the stub name and 2) the name of the 
    sub-directory inside $orm_path where the corresponding PHP files will be written.
    E.g. assuming the default $orm_path, then "--model=foobar" would cause the 
    model/schema/foobar.mysql.schema.xml to be parsed and the corresponding PHP classes to be
    generated inside of model/foobar/

--orm_path : (string, defaults to "model/")
    Identifies the parent folder (relative to package root) where sub-folders for the various models
    and for "schema/".  Specify a custom value if your project is significantly complex enough to 
    merit organization that goes beyond the default value.

--table_prefix : (string, optional)
    The table name prefix used to identify a sub-set of tables.

--overwrite (mixed: true|false|force) 
    This controls how conflicting files are handled. When false (i.e. not set), the script behaves 
    cowardly and will exit if any conflict is detected.  When true, the script will attempt to 
    politely rename any conflicting files with a name corresponding to the Unix timestamp: these 
    files should be manually reviewed.  Using the "force" option will delete any conflicting files. 
    Use with extreme caution!
    Default: false.

--restrict_prefix : (boolean, optional) Normally you want to only write schema corresponding to the 
    tables with the given table_prefix, but you can ignore this restriction by setting this to false.
    Default: true.

--dir_perms : (optional) the permissions mask to use if it is necessary to create directories.
    The global default is 0777, and it should rarely need to be changed: permissions are best
    left defined by the parent environment not forced by this script.


Examples:


Parse the XML file located at model/schema/mypre.mysql.schema.xml into classfiles.

    php repoman.php schema:parse <pkg_root_dir> --table_prefix=mypre_ --model=mypkg    

Attempt to rename files during the operation:

    php repoman.php schema:parse <pkg_root_dir> --action=parse --table_prefix=mypre_ --model=mypkg
